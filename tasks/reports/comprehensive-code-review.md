## Detailed Analysis by Layer

## 1. Core/Domain Layer Analysis

### 1.1 FiniteAutomaton Implementation

**File:** `/src/Core/Model/FiniteAutomaton.php`

- **Missing:** No serialization support directly in the model

**Score: 4.5/5** - Excellent implementation with minor enhancements needed

### 1.2 Value Objects

#### State.php (Lines 1-29)

- ✅ Implements Stringable interface correctly
- ⚠️ Missing: No hash/equality comparison beyond string comparison

#### TransitionFunction.php (Lines 1-79)
- ✅ Excellent O(1) lookup optimization with hash table
- ✅ Proper validation of transition targets
- ⚠️ **Line 54-57:** Uses trigger_error instead of proper logging
